    It is possible to add custom business logic after a Backend user resets their
    password using the new PSR-14 event.

The event :php-short:`\TYPO3\CMS\Backend\Authentication\Event\PasswordHasBeenResetEvent`
is raised right after a backend user resets their password
and it has been hashed and persisted to the database.

The event contains the corresponding backend user UID.
